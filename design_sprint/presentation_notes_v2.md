## 2. Design Choices & Visual Integration

*   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Each slide uses headings, subheadings, and body text effectively to guide the viewer's eye.

*   **Action Buttons & Navigation:** Consistent styling for CTAs and navigation elements.
*   **Export Options:** The "Export to PDF" and "Export to HTML" buttons provide practical utility.

This revised presentation aims to be a powerful tool for communicating mybidfit's vision, strategic depth, and innovative capabilities to a diverse audience.
