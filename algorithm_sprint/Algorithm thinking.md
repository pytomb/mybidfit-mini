There are multiple types of algorithms we need: 1\.  A way to review/analyze the supplier website and case            │

│   studies to extract as much useful information as possible that can be helpful in matching a supplier with            │

│   another supplier, understanding complimentatry skills, relationships, geography, client experience.  2\. A way        │

│   to evaluate how well of a fit a company is for a given opportunity, by, so we have to be able to evaluate            │

│   problem statements and/or RFIs, RFPs, or other requirement data.  We will also need an algorithm that looks at       │

│   perspective buyer/org behavior to recommend events, organizations, clubs and other things to invest time and         │

│   money in.  There is another level of depth on the analysis of the opportunity that also includes how does a          │

│   potential partner best help that customer better qualify for an opportunity.   Can you help me think through what types of algorithms make sense for these goals, and any other feedback is welcome.


Got you, Derek. Let’s turn this into a clean, shippable plan you can build against without inviting a lawsuit or a mystery box. I’ll lay out the algorithms by goal, what they take in, what they spit out, how they score, and the guardrails.

# **1\) Supplier understanding from sites & case studies**

**Goal:** turn messy marketing copy into structured, comparable data.

**Inputs**

* Website/pages, PDFs, case studies, social posts, awards/press.

* Optional: SIC/NAICS, size, certs, geos, tech stack.

**Pipeline**

1. **Content fetch & de-dup**

   * Crawl \+ PDF text extraction, boilerplate removal, language detection.

2. **Information extraction (IE)**

   * LLM-assisted IE with a strict JSON schema \+ regex/NER validators.

   * Entities: services, industries, clients (normalized), geos, certifications, tooling, outcomes/metrics, partners, compliance.

3. **Taxonomy & skill mapping**

   * Zero-shot/keyword+embedding mapping to a controlled skills/industry taxonomy.

4. **Quality/credibility scoring**

   * Signals: recency, specificity (numbers, metrics), external mentions, case depth, team bios, customer logos, code repos, conference talks.

   * Score \= weighted sum with caps \+ decay on staleness.

5. **Embeddings**

   * Sentence embeddings per skill, industry, capability, and “proof snippet”.

6. **Graph building**

   * Knowledge graph: **Company → (capability, industry, client, geo, cert, partner)** nodes/edges.

**Algorithms**

* IE: LLM \+ pattern checks; backstop with spaCy NER for dates/orgs/locations.

* Skill mapping: embedding similarity \+ TF-IDF fallback.

* Credibility: logistic regression/XGBoost on signals.

* Graph storage: property graph (Neo4j) or RDF; use for paths and partner suggestions.

**Outputs**

* Capability vector, industry vector, geo vector, cert vector, “proof pack” (citations back to source).

**Guardrails**

* Keep extracted JSON visible; clickable citations to source text.

* Confidence per field; flag low-confidence for review.

# **2\) Supplier↔Supplier matching (complements & partnerships)**

**Goal:** find pairs/sets that “cover the board” for a buyer.

**Features**

* **Complementarity:** cosine distance across capability vectors (want *different but adjacent*, not clones).

* **Coverage:** union of skills vs. target opportunity skills.

* **Scale fit:** headcount, geography overlap/coverage.

* **Credibility blend:** combine credibility scores (with diminishing returns).

* **Relationship graph:** shared clients/certs; “two hops” partner paths.

**Algorithms**

* **Multi-objective ranking:** Weighted sum with tunable weights per buyer scenario.

* **Team formation / set cover:** greedy set cover or ILP to pick the smallest partner set that covers required skills/geos/compliance.

* **Graph features:** shortest-path to “trusted” nodes; common neighbors (Adamic-Adar) for warm intros.

**Output**

* Ranked partner list, plus 2–3 partner “bundles” that maximize coverage at minimal cost.

---

# **3\) Fit-to-opportunity scoring (RFI/RFP/problem statements)**

**Goal:** “How good is Supplier X for Opportunity O?”

**Inputs**

* Parsed RFP/RFI/problem text; structured requirements (must/should/could), evaluation criteria, weights, timelines, compliance.

**Pipeline**

1. **Requirement parsing**

   * LLM parses sections → normalized requirement objects with type, weight, evidence needed.

2. **Constraint checks**

   * Hard filters first: mandatory certs, geo, clearances, size, past-perf thresholds.

3. **Signal match**

   * Requirement embeddings vs. supplier capability & **proof pack** embeddings.

   * Evidence retrieval with snippet citations.

4. **Scoring**

   * **Two-stage**:

     * Stage A: Constraint pass/fail with reasons.

     * Stage B: Learning-to-Rank (LambdaMART/XGBoost) or transparent weighted scoring if you want max auditability.

**Score components (example)**

* Coverage of must-haves (0–100)

* Strength of proof (0–100) — number/quality of cited wins

* Domain proximity (0–100)

* Risk flags (recent layoffs, legal issues, delivery gaps)

* Delivery fit (timeline capacity, onsite needs, travel)

**Output**

* A top-line score with **explanations** and **citations** to supplier text.

* “What to fix” list: missing certs, weak proof, partner gaps.

**Guardrails**

* Expose rubric and weights; allow user to tweak and see the effect.

* Keep a versioned “scorecard recipe” for audit.

---

# **4\) Event/org/club recommendations (where to invest time & money)**

**Goal:** suggest **types** of rooms to be in, not stalk people.

**Inputs**

* Target account list, public org calendars, award lists, board rosters, conference agendas, chapter memberships, sponsorship data.

**Signals**

* Buyer org presence (sponsors, speakers, awards).

* Attendee composition (roles relevant to your ICP).

* Match to supplier’s industries/capabilities.

* Cost vs. probable access (small dinners \> mega expos, sometimes).

* **Diversity of touchpoints** (avoid all-eggs-one-basket).

**Algorithms**

* **Knowledge-based \+ bandit hybrid**:

  * Start with rules/filters (industry, geo, role mix, cost).

  * Rank via gradient boosted model on historical conversion proxies (meetings set, intros gained), if available.

  * **Contextual bandits** to learn which event types work for each sales persona over time.

* **Time-decay** so old success doesn’t dominate.

* **Portfolio optimizer**: pick a monthly mix under a budget to maximize expected conversations/meetings.

**Output**

* Ranked list by *event type* and specific examples, with estimated ROI (meetings/$) and a simple monthly plan.

**Privacy**

* Only public signals. No “Person X will be at Y.”

---

# **5\) “Partner lifts fit” — how a partner changes the score**

**Goal:** show the delta if Supplier A teams with Partner B for Opportunity O.

**Method**

* Recompute the opportunity score after **union** of capabilities, proofs, certs, geos.

* Penalize overlap (duplicate strengths) and coordination risk.

* Add **reference blend**: if Partner B has direct past-perf with the buyer or buyer’s peer group, boost with a cap.

**Algorithm**

* **Counterfactual scoring:** Score(A), Score(B), Score(A∪B) → show lift and which requirements flipped from red→green.

* Use Shapley-style attribution to show which partner contributed what.

---

# **Cross-cutting tech choices**

* **Embeddings:** domain-tuned sentence embeddings (keep the model versioned).

* **Graph:** Neo4j for partner paths and community detection.

* **Ranking:** start with transparent weights; add LTR once you have labels.

* **Evaluation:** precision@k for matches, calibration curves for scores, win-rate correlation once you get outcomes.

* **Feedback loop:** per-decision thumbs up/down \+ “why”; use to retrain LTR and bandits.

* **Explainability:** every score comes with reasons, snippets, and a link back to the source.

---

# **Bias, safety, and audit (so we sleep at night)**

* **Rubric transparency:** weights are visible and user-tunable; save presets.

* **Feature hygiene:** no protected attributes or obvious proxies in models.

* **Two-step scoring:** constraints then merits; constraints are edited in plain English.

* **Fairness checks:** compare scores across segments for drift; document fixes.

* **Model cards:** purpose, data sources, known limits, retrain schedule.

* **Human-in-the-loop:** low-confidence fields route to review before they affect scores.

---

# **Data schema (condensed)**

* **Company:** id, size, geos, certs, industries\[\], capabilities\[\], tech\[\], credibility\_score, embeddings{capability, industry}, proofs\[{text, url, metric?, client?, date}\]

* **Opportunity:** id, buyer, must/should/could requirements\[{text, weight, type, evidence\_needed}\], constraints, dates, eval\_criteria

* **MatchResult:** company\_id, opp\_id, stageA\_pass, score\_breakdown, reasons\[\], citations\[\]

* **Event:** id, type, org, date, geo, cost, audience\_roles\[\], sponsors\[\], past\_attendee\_orgs\[\]

* **PartnerBundle:** company\_ids\[\], coverage, risk, cost, score\_lift

---

# **Build order (MVP → V2)**

**MVP (4–6 weeks)**

1. Website/Case Study IE → JSON \+ citations.

2. Simple supplier vectors \+ cosine search.

3. Hard-filter constraints for RFPs \+ weighted scoring with explanations.

4. Basic partner bundle via greedy set cover.

5. Event recs \= rules \+ scoring from public data; monthly portfolio with manual labels.

**V2**

* Knowledge graph \+ partner pathing.

* Learning-to-Rank for fit scores.

* Contextual bandits for event types.

* Counterfactual partner lift with Shapley attribution.

* Credibility model trained on “proof” features.

---

# **What I’d test first**

* **Does the extracted JSON hold up?** (≥95% field accuracy on a 50-site sample)

* **Do explanations feel true?** (sales/buyer panel review)

* **Partner bundles:** run against 10 real opportunities and ask, “Would you pitch this trio?”

If you want, I’ll turn this into a one-page PRD with fields, APIs, and sample payloads next. And yes—we’ll keep the wording human so GPTZero doesn’t side-eye your deck.

One of the thoughts I had was to minimize risk of bias or being accused of bias, was to give the feedback almost like a TV show, like Americas got Talent, where each persona/judge has a unique perspective and they give an X or an O, based on their persona, or a scale of 1 to 5, which might give more range on the scale of scores. This approach may allow the scoring to be more intentionally subjective, like the Technical Judge can be extremely hyperfocused, or the domain persona could do the same, and so one. Just thinking out loud right now...

That’s actually a very clever way to **lean into subjectivity instead of pretending it doesn’t exist.** It reframes the scoring as “different informed perspectives” rather than “one objective truth.” That makes it more transparent and harder to accuse of hidden bias. Here’s how you could structure it:

---

## **🎤 The “Panel of Judges” Approach**

* **Technical Judge** – hyperfocused on certifications, standards, tooling, security, compliance. They might give an “X” for any missing must-have cert, even if the rest looks strong.

* **Domain Judge** – focused on industry experience, customer logos, and relevance of past work. They’re strict on fit-to-domain but looser on general capabilities.

* **Value-for-Money Judge** – cares about cost efficiency, scalability, and track record of delivering on time/on budget.

* **Innovation Judge** – rewards uniqueness, thought leadership, IP, patents, or new approaches.

* **Relationship Judge** – cares about geography, partnerships, references, cultural/relationship fit.

Each judge has a **clear persona \+ rubric** that you publish. That way, buyers/suppliers know what lens each “score” comes from.

---

## **🟢 Benefits of this method**

1. **Bias transparency**  
    Instead of hiding subjective weighting, you make it part of the design—“this is how different buyers might see you.”

2. **Richer storytelling**  
    A supplier can say, “we scored low with Technical Judge, but high with Relationship Judge,” which is a conversation starter, not a rejection.

3. **Explorable results**  
    Users can toggle: *show me Technical Judge only* vs. *show me the blended score*.

4. **Auditability**  
    You can store each judge’s criteria \+ evidence → if challenged, you show receipts.

---

## **⚖️ Design Choices to Consider**

* **Scale**: binary (✔/✖) keeps it clean, but 1–5 gives nuance and room for growth (like “not there yet” vs. “strong”).

* **Blending**: show both *individual judge scores* and an *overall average/weighted score*. Buyers can decide whose opinion they trust more.

* **Custom panels**: allow the buyer to *choose their judges*—maybe they only care about Technical \+ Value-for-Money this time.

* **Explainability**: each judge cites the **evidence** for their score, e.g.

  * *Technical Judge: ✖ – No ISO27001 certification found.*

  * *Domain Judge: 4/5 – Case study with Delta Airlines matches aerospace industry.*

---

## **🚀 Where this could go**

* Start with 3–4 core judges → expand over time as you learn what perspectives buyers actually care about.

* Could even gamify: suppliers “audition” in front of judges (like *Shark Tank for procurement*).

* Later, you could train LLMs to mimic buyer personas you’ve interviewed—so the Domain Judge isn’t generic, it “thinks like” a CPO you modeled it on.

---

👉 My take: this is both safer (reduces accusations of hidden bias) and stickier (people *remember* feedback from “the picky Technical Judge” more than a faceless score).

Would you like me to **mock up an example scorecard**—say, Supplier A responding to RFP \#101—showing how 3 different judges give their ratings and reasons? That could help visualize how this feels in practice.
