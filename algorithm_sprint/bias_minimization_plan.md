# mybidfit: AI Bias Minimization Plan for Buyer-Supplier Fit Scoring

This document outlines a concrete plan to minimize the risk of bias in mybidfit's buyer-supplier fit scoring tool, directly leveraging the strategies discussed in the `ai_bias_mitigation.md` document. Our goal is to ensure fairness, transparency, and user empowerment, protecting both our users and mybidfit from legal and reputational risks.

## Core Principles Guiding Bias Minimization:

1.  **Transparency & Explainability:** Make the scoring process understandable.
2.  **User Control & Human Oversight:** Empower users to guide the AI and maintain accountability.
3.  **Comparative & Contextual Output:** Provide insights, not black-box verdicts.
4.  **Proactive Bias Audits:** Continuously test and tune the algorithm for fairness.
5.  **Accountability & Compliance:** Establish internal policies and stay abreast of regulations.

## Detailed Plan & Implementation Strategies:

### 1. Transparent Scoring Criteria and Extreme Candor

*   **Action:** Develop a comprehensive, publicly accessible (or user-facing) documentation of the scoring rubric.
    *   **Details:** Clearly list all factors influencing the fit score (e.g., past project success, certifications, industry-specific experience, size, location, diversity status if applicable and consented).
    *   **Details:** Explicitly state how each factor is weighted and how the final score is calculated. Avoid hiding normalization or exact calculations.
*   **Action:** Implement explainability features for each individual score.
    *   **Details:** For every buyer-supplier match or sales opportunity score, provide a clear breakdown: "Supplier A scored X because of high ratings in Y and Z, but a lower score in A."
    *   **Details:** Integrate this explanation directly into the UI (e.g., tooltips, expandable sections, or a dedicated "Score Rationale" view).
*   **Action:** Conduct internal reviews to justify every input factor.
    *   **Details:** If a factor cannot be comfortably explained or justified as business-relevant and non-discriminatory, it should be reconsidered or removed.

### 2. User-Controlled Weighting with Oversight

*   **Action:** Enhance user control over scoring rubric weights.
    *   **Details:** Allow users to adjust weights for various criteria (e.g., "past performance," "client fit," "cost-effectiveness") within predefined, reasonable bounds.
    *   **Details:** Provide a clear UI for weight adjustment, possibly with sliders or input fields.
*   **Action:** Implement guardrails and guidance for user-defined weights.
    *   **Details:** Provide default weight settings that have been pre-tested for fairness.
    *   **Details:** Display warnings if a user's custom weight selection could potentially skew results or disproportionately impact certain groups (e.g., "Warning: This weighting might reduce visibility for smaller businesses").
*   **Action:** Ensure human oversight and review of scoring rationale.
    *   **Details:** Always allow users to review the raw data and detailed scoring rationale for each candidate (supplier or opportunity), not just the final score.
    *   **Details:** Design the product as a decision support system, not an autocratic judge. Emphasize that the user's judgment can override or adjust for nuances the score can't capture.

### 3. Comparative and Contextual Output (Rather than a Black-Box Verdict)

*   **Action:** Frame product output as comparative analysis, not definitive verdicts.
    *   **Details:** Instead of "Fit Score: 62/100 - Not a Match," present "Supplier B ranks in the 90th percentile on cost-effectiveness but 50th percentile on past project size."
    *   **Details:** Implement visual dashboards or reports that highlight how a supplier ranks across multiple criteria or relative to other suppliers in the same category/cohort.
*   **Action:** Design UI and outputs to encourage critical thinking.
    *   **Details:** Prompt questions like "Why is this match scored higher?" and "What differentiates these opportunities?" rather than just "Which one is green-lit by the AI?".
    *   **Details:** Ensure the output helps expose any odd patterns (e.g., if all top-scoring suppliers are large firms, users should easily notice this).

### 4. Built-in Fairness Checks and Bias Audits

*   **Action:** Establish a routine for performing bias audits on scoring outcomes.
    *   **Details:** Simulate or review scores to identify if certain protected groups (e.g., small businesses, diverse-owned businesses, new entrants) are consistently rated lower without a clear business-necessary reason.
    *   **Details:** Define metrics for fairness (e.g., disparate impact, equal opportunity).
*   **Action:** Address potential proxy biases in data sources.
    *   **Details:** Be mindful that historical data (case studies, website content) can reflect societal biases (e.g., favoring glossy websites). Identify and adjust models or weights to compensate.
    *   **Details:** Ensure training data and scoring logic are as representative and inclusive as possible. Consider incorporating diversity as a conscious factor or ensuring it's not negatively correlated.
*   **Action:** Implement regular algorithm impact reviews.
    *   **Details:** Review the algorithm's impact semi-annually or whenever significant changes are made to the model or data.
    *   **Details:** If bias is detected (e.g., suppliers under a certain size consistently score poorly), investigate the root cause and implement corrective actions (e.g., compare within cohorts like "new entrants" vs. "established firms").
*   **Action:** Document all fairness tests and adjustments.
    *   **Details:** Maintain a clear record of bias audits, findings, and corrective measures taken. This serves as evidence of proactive bias management.

### 5. Extreme Accountability and Compliance Measures

*   **Action:** Establish an internal AI ethics or governance policy for mybidfit.
    *   **Details:** Designate an individual or a small committee responsible for overseeing responsible AI use, reviewing scoring mechanisms, and addressing issues.
*   **Action:** Stay abreast of evolving AI regulations and guidelines.
    *   **Details:** Monitor laws in target markets (e.g., Colorado AI Act, government procurement guidelines on ethical AI).
    *   **Details:** Prepare to answer detailed questionnaires on bias mitigation, fairness testing, and explainability for regulated sectors.
*   **Action:** Publish a transparency or fairness statement.
    *   **Details:** Clearly describe data usage (what is used, what is not, e.g., no personal demographics), model validation, and how users can appeal or correct scores.
    *   **Details:** Be candid about the scoring rubric's limitations.
*   **Action:** Build in auditability features.
    *   **Details:** Implement audit logs or explainability reports for each recommendation to facilitate future compliance audits or legal discovery.

By implementing this comprehensive plan, mybidfit can deliver its core value proposition with integrity, build user trust, and proactively mitigate the significant risks associated with AI bias. This commitment to fairness will become a key differentiator and selling point in the market.
