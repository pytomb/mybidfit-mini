lsof -i :8001

# Kill the process or use different port

```

#### Dashboard Won't Open
```bash
# Manually open the URL
open http://localhost:8001/internal-dashboard.html

# Or check server logs
./start-dashboard.sh -v  # verbose mode
```

#### Script Permission Denied
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x start-dashboard.sh stop-dashboard.sh

# Or run directly with bash
bash start-dashboard.sh
```

### Performance Issues
- **Large Datasets**: Charts may slow with >1000 data points
- **Memory Usage**: Refresh browser if dashboard becomes sluggish
- **Chart Rendering**: Resize window to trigger chart re-rendering
