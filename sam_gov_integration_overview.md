Here is an overview of the work done to integrate the SAM.gov API:

**1. Research and API Selection:**

*   Researched various federal government APIs for contract opportunities.
*   Selected the `SAM.gov "Get Opportunities" API` as the primary source for federal bids due to its comprehensive data and RESTful interface.

**2. API Key Configuration:**

*   Obtained the necessary API key for SAM.gov.
*   Stored the API key securely in the `.env` file under the variable `SAM_GOV_API_KEY` to avoid hardcoding it in the source code.

**3. Core Integration:**

*   Installed the `axios` library to facilitate HTTP requests to the SAM.gov API.
*   Created a dedicated integration module at `src/integrations/sam.js`.
*   Implemented a `fetchOpportunities` function within this module to handle the logic of calling the SAM.gov API and returning the data.

**4. API Endpoint:**

*   Created a new API endpoint at `/api/opportunities` to expose the functionality of the `fetchOpportunities` function.
*   This was done by creating a new route file at `src/routes/opportunities.js` and wiring it up in the main `src/server.js` file.

**5. Testing:**

*   Created a new integration test file at `test/integration/sam-api.test.js` to test the SAM.gov API integration in isolation.
*   This test directly calls the `fetchOpportunities` function and verifies that it successfully retrieves data from the API.
*   Configured the testing environment by updating the `test:integration` script in `package.json` to load the API key from the `.env` file during tests.

This integration provides a solid foundation for fetching real-time federal contract opportunities and incorporating them into the MyBidFit platform.
